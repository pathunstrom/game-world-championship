# The Rules

A game is a battle between two characters.
Each player brings a character and a deck to play.
The object of the game is to remove every card from your opponent's deck.

1. Place your character in the center of your play space and the deck to one side.
2. Draw initial hand and decide if you would like to mulligan.
3. A mulligan is performed by selecting any number of cards in your hand
   and putting them on the bottom of your deck then drawing that many cards.
4. Then without looking at them put the top 3 cards of your deck into a separate pile next to your deck.
   This pile is your energy.
5. Choose the active player. Active player plays first on a round and switches every round.

You're ready to play.

## Concepts

A list of game concepts that need definitions

### Dealing Damage

When a player is dealt damage, follow these steps:

1. Reduce the damage amount by 1 and flip the top card of their deck into their discard pile.
2. Look in the top right corner of the card for defense icons, reduce the remaining damage by the number there.
3. If the defense icons exactly match the remaining damage, put the card in your hand. (Perfect Defense)
4. If the defense card has a defense trigger, resolve it now.
5. If you have damage remaining, return to 1.

You are done once there is no more damage to take.

### Paying Energy

To pay an energy cost, put cards from the top of your energy pile onto the bottom of your deck.
If you do not have enough energy cards to pay the cost, you may not pay the cost.

## Round Structure

A round is broken into 3 steps:

1. Ready
2. Combat
3. End of Round

### Ready Step

Right now, the only thing to do here is power up and draw.
We'll formalize how much energy later.
Also character levels are a future concern,
as well as "at the start of turn" effects.

1. Power up by putting cards from the top of your deck into your energy pile.
2. Draw two cards.

### Combat Step

In the combat step you will set yourself up and attack your opponent.
Starting with the active player, take turns performing one action.
When both players pass in succession, the combat step ends.

The actions to perform:

1. Attack - Play an attack card from your hand and resolve it.
2. Drill - Play a Drill from your hand.
3. Pass - Pass your turn.

#### Playing an attack

To play an attack:

1. Pay its cost from your energy pool.
2. If the card has an effect, do what it says.
3. Deal damage equal to the arrows in the bottom right corner.

#### Playing a drill

1. Pay its cost from your energy pool.
2. Put it into play behind your character. 
   Its affect applies as long as its in play.

#### Pass

You do nothing, your opponent takes their turn.
If your opponent attacks you, you do not need to pass on your next turn.
If both players pass in succession, combat is over.

### End Step

1. Discard down to hand size.
2. End of round effects (there are none!)
3. The active player passes to the other player.

## Snippets of possible mechanics for the future

1. Character levels: Stack of cards, get more powerful as the fight goes on.
2. Attack types:
   * One deals damage to "energy" and then life, but tends to cost less.
   * One deals damage to the life deck directly.
3. Blocks? Use left/right/center or high/low/neutral on attacks and blocks. Fighting game mechanics get?
4. Mini mulligan every turn IE draw 6, put two into your energy pile or something.
   * Tie this to character level, so you draw more cards to tune and get more energy as the game goes.
5. Deck build limitations, needs combat styles, more robust characters. See Star Wars Unlimited and The Spoils for ideas.
6. Regen
7. Allies
8. More subtle damage: Flips defend 0, only defense icons. This makes for some silly design space like 0 life cards of damage.
9. Regarding 1: Cards that can only be played at higher levels
