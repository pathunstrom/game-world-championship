Snippets of possible mechanics for the future

1. Character levels: Stack of cards, get more powerful as the fight goes on.
2. Blocks? Use left/right/center or high/low/neutral on attacks and blocks. Fighting game mechanics get?
3. Mini mulligan every turn IE draw 6, put two into your energy pile or something.
   * Tie this to character level, so you draw more cards to tune and get more energy as the game goes.
4. Deck build limitations, needs combat styles, more robust characters. See Star Wars Unlimited and The Spoils for ideas.
6. Allies
8. Regarding 1: Cards that can only be played at higher levels
9. Reaction cards: Follow rules of printed reactions
10. Blocks: Reactions that respond to attacks
11. Combo mechanics. Combo X: May keep the turn and play if you have played X or fewer cards this turn.
12. When discarding at end of turn, put it face down in your energy pile.

## Combo Thoughts

Two approaches:

1. Combo x on a card means "I can play an X cost attack after this card."
2. Combo x on a card means "I can play this card if I have played X or less cards this turn."

### Approach 1: Play an X cost card after this one.

Makes it clear to opponent a combo is coming, no interrupting flow of play.

### Approach 2: May play if you played x or less cards this turn

Makes balance a little easier.
