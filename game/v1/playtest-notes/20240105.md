# Feedback

* Stunning blow entirely too good for turn 1
* Taunting Strike is underwhelming
* Maybe perfect guard gives extra energy instead of cards?
* Drills being 1 per turn means they can be more powerful.
* Consideration: Drills can be a risk to have "too many" in play. Ways to reduce drills.
* More vanilla attacks
* Reversal only in response to attacks.
* Character idea: Swap attack and block value mechanic
* Combat Drill: Attack is fine, initial cost feels low.

# Self - Piper

* Need more low cost drills (0-1)
* Basic flow is _excellent_
* Power budgets need to be part of the next step.
